This is a simple library for fixed-point arithmetic.
It supports operator overloading for the four basic arithmetic operations.
For these operations, it's compatible for with any integer or floating point number.
It also supports these operations for objects of the same type with the same 
precision of digits. For constructing a number, it also supports
using any integer or floating point type. From testing, a single operation is
10 times slower than the base arithmetic operations. But these could vary depending
on the system.
